#TidyTuesday Exercises

Repository of .R and .Rmd files documenting my participation in the #TidyTuesday community weekly data project. Each week (when I have some free time!), I explore the #TidyTuesday dataset with a new R {package} to grow my R skills and learn new methods of data manipulation and visualization.
